# Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Computing with PyMC

Material for course on Bayesian Computation

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fonnesbeck/bayes_course_dec_2023/main) 

## Setup

This tutorial assumes that you have some form of [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#download-section) Python (with Python version 3.11) setup and installed on your system. If you do not, please download and install this on your system before proceeding with the setup. We recommend using the [Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#download) distribution of Anaconda, which is a lightweight version of Anaconda that is easier to work with.

The next step is to clone or download the tutorial materials in this repository. If you are familiar with Git, run the clone command:

    git clone https://github.com/fonnesbeck/bayes_course_dec_2023.git

otherwise you can [download a zip file](https://github.com/fonnesbeck/bayes_course_dec_2023/archive/main.zip) of its contents, and unzip it on your computer.
***
The repository for this tutorial contains a file called `environment.yml` that includes a list of all the packages used for the tutorial. If you run:

    mamba env create

from the main tutorial directory (if you installed Anaconda instead of Miniforge, use `conda` instead of `mamba`), it will create the environment for you and install all of the packages listed. This environment can be enabled using:

    mamba activate bayes_course  

or 
    
    conda activate bayes_course

Then, you can start **JupyterLab** to access the materials:

    jupyter lab

The binder link above should also provide a working environment.

For those who like to work in VS Code, you can also run Jupyter notebooks from within VS Code. To do this, you will need to install the [Jupyter extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter). Once this is installed, you can open the notebooks in the `notebooks` subdirectory and run them interactively.

## Pre-course Work

In advance of the course, we would like attendees to complete a short homework notebook that will ensure everyone has the requisite baseline knowledge. You can find this Jupyter notebook in the `/notebooks` subdirectory (under `Section0-Pre_Work.ipynb`). There is no need to hand this in to anyone, but please reach out if you have difficulty with any of the problems (or with setting up your computing environment) by creating an [issue](https://github.com/fonnesbeck/bayes_course_dec_2023/issues) in this repository, or by emailing.
